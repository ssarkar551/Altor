**Altor Dashboard**
Description
This project is a comprehensive dashboard solution, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for data visualization and management. It is divided into two main components: a backend server built with Express.js and MongoDB for database management, and a frontend interface created with Next.js.

Project Structure
backend: This directory contains the server-side logic of the application, built with Express.js. It is responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the MongoDB database, and performing server-side operations.
